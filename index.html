                <p>Pollution poses a range of detrimental effects on the environment, leading to various ecological
                    imbalances and health concerns. Here are some key problems caused by pollution and their impacts:

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/VcDjyxanOyk" target="https://youtu.be/VcDjyxanOyk">Health Impacts:</a> Pollution, especially air and water
                        pollution, leads to severe health issues
                        such as respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and cancers among humans. It also affects
                        wildlife and aquatic organisms, disrupting ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/oqdcRdUJjdg" target="https://youtu.be/oqdcRdUJjdg">Environmental Degradation</a> Pollution damages soil
                        quality, depletes ozone in the atmosphere,
                        contributes to global warming through greenhouse gas emissions, and contaminates water bodies.
                        This results in habitat destruction, disrupted food chains, and overall ecosystem instability.

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/GHACDpba6Nk" target="https://youtu.be/GHACDpba6Nk">Economic Consequences:</a> Pollution-related healthcare
                        costs, decreased agricultural productivity,
                        and damage to infrastructure translate into economic losses. Additionally, industries may face
                        regulatory actions and reputation damage due to their role in pollution, affecting profitability
                        and growth.
